# take-a-walk

I was on a flight playing around with random walkers, thinking about mazes and this iteration lept off my screen out of nowhere. It's a fork of my spiral-square project that ended up being more beautiful than I imagined. It's fun to play with the width size, number of walkers, and refresh rate.
